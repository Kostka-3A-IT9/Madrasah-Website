		<h3 Id="center">Project وعي ( Awareness )</h3><br>
		<p align="center">Our project is all about raising campaigns and uploading posters publicly about the Institution and it's <b>agenda</b>.

		<h3 id="center">Intervention</h3>
		<p align="center">
		This proposed project solution is better than the other alternatives such as volunteering, because this gets a larger scale of people to notice help. This project would need a bit more help than just <b>four students from Grade 9</b> and will need some money for the paper, for printing, for the campaigns (<b>websites</b>), we can also help by posting online for many people to see. <br>
		<h3 id="center">Rationale</h3>

		This project is very important as it will help the Institution a lot especially the students.

<p align="center">
MADRASAH is an educational Institution that the government acknowledges and keeps in mind. Unfortunately, there isn't much advertising going on to continue to promote this institution to the general public. We can influence others to address the challenge by spreading awareness using our digital skills and tools.<br><br>
Our project proposal is to help promote the partner institution of Ma-a by using our modern utilities and connections. We can raise our concerns to our local government through some people and ultimately help their situation become better. We may also do this through volunteering our services to the branch.<br>

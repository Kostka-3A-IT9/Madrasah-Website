		Compost is an excellent <b>organic</b> material that can be used as a fertilizer or to <b>amend</b> the soil. Compost helps <b>balance</b> soil density, <b>aids</b> in the plants' ability to absorb water, <b>prevents</b> plants from drying out as quickly, and gives them resistance to <b>disease and pests</b>.<br><br></p>

	   <b>Malabar Spinach</b>, also known locally as <b>Alugbati</b> or <b>Basella alba L.</b> is the scientific name for this <b>herbaceous vine</b>. For optimal growth, it requires sunlight, soil, and plenty of water. Phosphorus, protein, vitamin A, and iron are also required.<br><br></p>
	   <p align="center">
	   <b>Homemade</b> compost is created using a <b>wide</b> range of materials under <b>aerobic</b> compost. Fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, eggshells, grass and plant clippings are all required. Phosphorus also helps condition and neutralize your soil, which increases phosphorus availability.<br><br></p>
	   <p align="center">
	   Benefits of aerobic compost include a <b>significant reduction in valuable waste</b> stream going off island, organics, soil, and water remaining on island. It also <b>improves</b>
	   soil structure and provides much-needed nutrients for plants.<br><br> </p>
	   <p align="center">
	   The effective way to apply and use the compost is to <b>spread</b> the compost in a <b>thick</b> layer on top of exposed soil. This would help the compost to <b>meld</b> with the soil. It could help the plant to be healthy because it would <b>contain</b> the plant's natural nutrients.<br><br></p>

        <br> <b>SIP Project Title</b> - The Value Of Composting	</br>
        <br><b>Problem</b>        - Will our Alugbati plant grow an abundance in the number of leaves and the diameter of the base leaves if we use a large amount of compost?</br>		
		<br><b>Hypothesis</b>        - If we use compost that contains or is high on phosphorus, then our Alugbati plant will grow in the number of leaves and the diameter of the base leaves.</br></p>
		<br><b>Independent Variable:</b> </br><br>
		<br> - The compost and compost ingredients. </br><br>
		<br> <b>Dependent Variable:</b> </br><br>
		<br> - Number of leaves on our plant. </br>
       <br>  - Size and or diameter of the base leaves of our plant .</br><br>
	   <br> <b>Controlled Variable:</b> </br><br>
	    <br>  - Amount of compost added to the fertilizer.</br>
        <br>   - Amount of water.  </br>
         <br>  - The soil used for the Malabar spinach plant.  </br>
		 <br><br>
		 <br><b>Materials for Compost</b>
		 <br> 3 pieces each</br>
		 <br> - Banana peels </br>
		 <br> - Onions  </br>
		 <br> - Peppers</br>
		 <br> - Cucumber</br>
		 <br> - Tomato </br>
		 <br> - 1 knife </br>
